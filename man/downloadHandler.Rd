\usage{
  downloadHandler(filename, content, contentType = NA)
}
\arguments{
  \item{filename}{A string of the filename, including
  extension, that the user's web browser should default to
  when downloading the file; or a function that returns
  such a string. (Reactive values and functions may be used
  from this function.)}

  \item{content}{A function that takes a single argument
  \code{con} that is a file connection opened in mode
  \code{wb}, and writes the content of the download into
  the connection. (Reactive values and functions may be
  used from this function.)}

  \item{contentType}{A string of the download's
  \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type}{content
  type}, for example \code{"text/csv"} or
  \code{"image/png"}. If \code{NULL} or \code{NA}, the
  content type will be guessed based on the filename
  extension, or \code{application/octet-stream} if the
  extension is unknown.}
}
\description{
  Allows content from the Shiny application to be made
  available to the user as file downloads (for example,
  downloading the currently visible data as a CSV file).
  Both filename and contents can be calculated dynamically
  at the time the user initiates the download.
